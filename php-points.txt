Magic methods: __get, __set, __call, __toString, __invoke

Reflection API

Generators (yield)

Anonymous classes

5. File Handling

12. Testing & Debugging

Xdebug and step debugging

Logging and error reporting

PHPUnit for unit testing

Mocking and test-driven development (TDD)

13. Performance & Optimization

Opcode caching (OPcache)

Database query optimization

Session management and caching strategies

Profiling and memory management

14. Deployment & Ecosystem

Setting up on Linux servers

Apache/Nginx configuration

SSL, security best practices

Version control (Git)

CI/CD pipelines

Tips to become an expert:

Build real projects (CMS, e-commerce, API, dashboard).

Contribute to open-source PHP projects.

Read PHP RFCs and updates regularly.

Master debugging, profiling, and performance tuning.

Stay updated with PHP 8.x features (JIT, attributes, union types, match expressions).
